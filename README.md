# Vizualization of transactions on Bitcoin

Unfinished project, which shows all transactions in bitcoin mempool on Canvas.

In current state it only shows all transactions as circles that move around the screen. Their size is measured by their transaction size. 

To run it you would need to have a running node on your computer.
